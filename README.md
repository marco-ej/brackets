# brackets
 Workplace Python challenge #3

 Prompt:

---
> "Create a function that tests whether the brackets within a string are valid (True/False).
e.g.: '(I love)(easyJet)' and '(easyJet (is) great)' are valid but '(I) love )RyanAir(' is not valid.
Harder version:
Account simultaneously for three types of brackets: (), [], {}. So '()[]{}' and '( [ {} ] )' are valid but '( { ) }' is not."
---

**N.B.** before running the script as is, you might want to comment out the very last two blocks that will time the performance of two different implementations. The test string is purposefully a worst case scenario and it's 20-million characters long, tested 100 times on each of the two functions.
